This is proof-of-concept code for a work project that didn't happen. It's small but some may be able to get something/learn from it.

Tech requirements:

    node >= 8.1.2
    npm": ">=16.13.1

Both are needed to install dependency packages and run a live server. But the most-recent version of Yarn should work without issues.
